 * interfaces.GameInterface represents the game state including the boards and the players
 *
 * Requires a constructor with two parameters: the two player objects. 
 *
 * Also requires a main method which allows the user to choose the player names and types and start the game. 
 * The main method menu should allow users to: create the players (human or computer); load a game; continue a game; save the game; start a new game; exit the program.
 *
 * If providing a GUI then the same options need to be available through the GUI.

The board that is passed to the players when choosing placements should be a clone of the game board so that they can try out moves without affecting the state of the game. Once ships are all placed the players should be asked one after another for their choice of shot via their getShot method. 
     * When a shot has been accepted by the game the player should be informed of the result of the shot.
